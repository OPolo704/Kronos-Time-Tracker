upload everything to localstorage not just sessionstorage since syncing is manual now

LOOKS BETTER WITH PREVIOUS BACKGROUND COLOR, ADJUST

MAIN
big one - minimum session length of like 2min
separate screen when a session is running which lets you change sessionName n shit
sessionName distributed between all split sessions
position i button absolutely
get rid of highlight when clicking buttons
last used category moves to top
style activity list sidebar
ACCOUNT POP UP 👨‍💻
sync functionality
log out functionality

STATS 
colors changeable by clicking on colorbox and dragging a hue slider 👨‍💻
maybe lower brightness of color when clicking
ellipsis on long text that overflows like WWWWWWWWWWWw
add presets for stat viewing, top preset becomes default
data export options
CATEGORY MANAGER
automatically uncheck main category if any one of the subcategories is disabled, enable all subcats if main cat is enabled
for the above feature, make subcategories' checkbox lower opacity to show that they're not individually controllable, only by parentcat
unselect all button
addbtn add default name when empty
make it so that id for newcat is also decided by first checking for empty arrays in sessionData and using them thus reusing some of the old ids
are you sure you want to delete category and all the sessions that are part of it? message
do something about untracked category & unsorted
on rename maintain check box state

CALENDAR
maybe change date select for a month calendar and/or ability to type in date similar to activity select
add for desktop a week and maybe month view option
do something about overlap?
add sessionblock detail window onclick 👨‍💻
maybe change sessionblocks inside to a grid and do it so that when possible have top div and then bottom div elements position name on top of duration, but when no space have name and duration on the same row
if I make a month view make it so that you can filter out by categories and see which days you've done x n such

general nice additions
ensure hover functionality on everything
sync animation on sync button
category manager smooth scroll up animation when opening and closing, maybe even slide down to close
make sure text is not selectable
calendar bottom and top add shadow when there is still space to scroll


block name "Unsorted" when making categories
block update drive while session running
when change to localstorage instead of sessionStorage complete, add a check to script.js for if a sesh is still running by adding newSession to localstorage

change viewedcategories to enabledcategories? or something different

REMOVE WHITE SPACE TO END THE CATEGORY NAME (aka "Coding " --> "Coding")
block duplicate names cat manager --> new idea when renaming to a prexesisting name, categories' sessions get merged under the new name with pop up warning
block empty as well with "Unnamed Category"



idea for future: when selecting activity clear select activity bar and turn it into a search bar the filters options
