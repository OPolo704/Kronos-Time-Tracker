refresh activity list when sync
overwrite/delete old kronosData.json
token refresh

run a check when syncing to eliminate deleted categories from sessionData array
remove scrollbar on main page

MAIN
big one - minimum session length of like 2min
separate screen when a session is running which lets you change sessionName n shit
warning when you try to end a session below 5min cuz of minimum session length
sessionName distributed between all split sessions
position i button absolutely
get rid of highlight when clicking buttons
last used category moves to top <- can actually code this using sessiondata 😱
style activity list sidebar
ACCOUNT POP UP 👨‍💻
sync functionality
log out functionality

STATS 
colors changeable by clicking on colorbox and dragging a hue slider 👨‍💻
maybe lower brightness of color when clicking
ellipsis on long text that overflows like WWWWWWWWWWWw
add presets for stat viewing, top preset becomes default
with the presets, also add date select --> date select a range of days and it will display the data for those days, maybe quick settings like (last) day, week, month or specific months (mar, feb..)
data export options
CATEGORY MANAGER
you can make any change to a category more efficient by finding the category using its parent elements instead of findCategory()
unselect all button
addbtn add default name when empty
make it so that id for newcat is also decided by first checking for empty arrays in sessionData and using them thus reusing some of the old ids
are you sure you want to delete category and all the sessions that are part of it? message
do something about untracked category & unsorted
on rename maintain check box state
limit amount of branching? 6 nested cats? - or make it so that when it going over the right margin it stops indenting each subcat
idea: new section that opens when you like hold on a category or something that lists all the previously recorded sessions of that cat

CALENDAR
make number of days accurate to the months' day count
show day of the week to the left of the date select
in the sessiondata foreach in calendar.js check for empty array at index maybe
maybe change date select for a month calendar and/or ability to type in date similar to activity select
add for desktop a week and maybe month view option
do something about overlap?
maybe change sessionblocks inside to a grid and do it so that when possible have top div and then bottom div elements position name on top of duration, but when no space have name and duration on the same row
if I make a month view make it so that you can filter out by categories and see which days you've done x n such
add checks for valid times when modifying time of session (starttime before endtime, valid time not 27:62, above min session time)
when the edited session is below minimum session time, delete (with the warning ofc)
refresh duration right after time change
add warning when deleting a session
add drag functionality to change the time when editing a session


general nice additions
ensure hover functionality on everything
sync animation on sync button
category manager smooth scroll up animation when opening and closing, maybe even slide down to close
make sure text is not selectable
calendar bottom and top add shadow when there is still space to scroll


block name "Unsorted" when making categories
block update drive while session running
when change to localstorage instead of sessionStorage complete, add a check to script.js for if a sesh is still running by adding newSession to localstorage

change viewedcategories to enabledcategories? or something different

REMOVE WHITE SPACE TO END THE CATEGORY NAME (aka "Coding " --> "Coding")
block duplicate names cat manager --> new idea when renaming to a prexesisting name, categories' sessions get merged under the new name with pop up warning
block empty as well with "Unnamed Category"



idea for future: when selecting activity clear select activity bar and turn it into a search bar the filters options
