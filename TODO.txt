style activity list sidebar

maybe lower brightness of color when clicking
ellipsis on long text that overflows like WWWWWWWWWWWw
add presets for stat viewing
data export options
CATEGORY MANAGER
add category button
make subcategory system
unselect all button
are you sure you want to delete category and all the sessions that are part of it? message
do something about untracked category


general nice additions
ensure hover functionality on everything
sync animation on sync button
category manager smooth scroll up animation when opening and closing, maybe even slide down to close


change viewedcategories to enabledcategories? or something different

REMOVE WHITE SPACE TO END THE CATEGORY NAME (aka "Coding " --> "Coding")
block duplicate names cat manager --> new idea when renaming to a prexesisting name, categories' sessions get merged under the new name with pop up warning




idea for future: when selecting activity clear select activity bar and turn it into a search bar the filters options
