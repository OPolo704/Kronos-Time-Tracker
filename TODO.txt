upload everything to localstorage not just sessionstorage since syncing is manual now

MAIN
position i button absolutely
get rid of highlight when clicking buttons
last used category moves to top
ACCOUNT POP UP
sync functionality
log out functionality

STATS 
category list follows category manager order
ellipsis on long text that overflows like WWWWWWWWWWWw
chart.js
add presets for stat viewing
when click on slice of pie chart shows percentage as well as total time
data export options
CATEGORY MANAGER
unselect all button
are you sure you want to delete category and all the sessions that are part of it? message


general nice additions
ensure hover functionality on everything
sync animation on sync button
category manager smooth scroll up animation when opening and closing, maybe even slide down to close


CURRENT: change viewedcategories to enabledcategories? or something different
add activity boolean yes or no property to categories
make eye button now toggle the activity boolean property


block duplicate names cat manager



idea for future: when selecting activity clear select activity bar and turn it into a search bar the filters options
