upload everything to localstorage not just sessionstorage since syncing is manual now

MAIN
big one - minimum session length of like 2min
position i button absolutely
get rid of highlight when clicking buttons
last used category moves to top
style activity list sidebar
ACCOUNT POP UP 👨‍💻
sync functionality
log out functionality

STATS 
colors changeable by clicking on colorbox and dragging a hue slider 👨‍💻
translate ms to hours and minutes 👨‍💻
maybe lower brightness of color when clicking
ellipsis on long text that overflows like WWWWWWWWWWWw
add presets for stat viewing
data export options
CATEGORY MANAGER
make subcategory system
unselect all button
addbtn add default name when empty
are you sure you want to delete category and all the sessions that are part of it? message
do something about untracked category
on rename maintain check box state

CALENDAR
make plus and minus buttons functional
maybe change date select for a month calendar and/or ability to type in date similar to activity select
add for desktop a week and maybe month view option
split sessions in between two different days and maybe extend to many different days as well in case 👨‍💻 (code into the actual finish session part)

general nice additions
ensure hover functionality on everything
sync animation on sync button
category manager smooth scroll up animation when opening and closing, maybe even slide down to close
make sure text is not selectable
calendar bottom and top add shadow when there is still space to scroll


change viewedcategories to enabledcategories? or something different

REMOVE WHITE SPACE TO END THE CATEGORY NAME (aka "Coding " --> "Coding")
block duplicate names cat manager --> new idea when renaming to a prexesisting name, categories' sessions get merged under the new name with pop up warning
block empty as well with "Unnamed Category"



idea for future: when selecting activity clear select activity bar and turn it into a search bar the filters options
